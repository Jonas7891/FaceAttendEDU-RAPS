abstract: |
  This document describes the technical procedure for the implementation, deployment, and startup of the FaceAttendEDU system. It details the deployment strategy based on containerization using Docker and orchestration with Docker Compose, ensuring the correct configuration of the data infrastructure (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Apache Kafka) and the deployment of polyglot microservices. The document provides a step-by-step guide covering from the minimum hardware and software requirements to the final verification protocol, ensuring that the operational environment is consistent, secure, and traceable.

# Introduction

The software implementation is the phase where the architectural design and the developed code are transformed into an operational and accessible system for users. For FaceAttendEDU, given the complexity of having nine microservices implemented in four different languages (Java, TypeScript, Python, and Go), a container-based deployment strategy has been adopted.

This approach eliminates the need to manually install each runtime environment on the host machine, encapsulating all dependencies within standardized images. This ensures that the system behaves identically in development, testing, and production environments.

## Document Objective
To establish the formal and detailed procedure for the installation, configuration, and deployment of the FaceAttendEDU system, allowing any qualified technician to put the platform into operation without errors and in a reproducible manner.

## Document Scope
The document covers the environment preparation, base tool installation, environment variable configuration, data infrastructure deployment, microservices orchestration, and the system health verification protocol. It does not include external network configuration (DNS, corporate Firewall) or high availability configuration in the cloud.

# Implementation Strategy

## Deployment Model: Containerization
The system utilizes **Docker** as the container platform and **Docker Compose** as the orchestrator. This choice allows the management of the 18 containers necessary (services, databases, gateway, and migration tasks) through a single configuration file.

### Network Organization
To ensure security, the deployment divides traffic into three isolated networks:
1. **Edge Network**: Connects the web interface and the Gateway (Kong).
2. **App Network**: Connects the Gateway with the microservices.
3. **Data Network**: Connects the microservices with the databases and the messaging broker.

This architecture prevents the presentation layer from having direct access to the data layer, mitigating the risk of direct attacks on the database.

# Implementation Requirements

## Hardware Requirements (Minimum)
| Resource | Requirement | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| RAM | 8 GB (16 GB Rec.) | Simultaneous execution of multiple JVMs and data engines. |
| CPU | 4 Cores (x86_64/ARM) | Biometric processing and container orchestration. |
| Disk | 20 GB free | Storage for Docker images and data volumes. |
| Network | Internet access | Download of base images and dependencies during the first build. |

## Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 (with WSL2), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, or macOS Ventura+.
- **Docker**: Version 24.0 or higher.
- **Docker Compose**: Version 2.20 or higher.
- **Git**: Version 2.40 or higher for obtaining the source code.

# Installation Procedure

## 1. Environment Preparation
Before starting, the installer must verify the availability of critical ports (e.g., 8080 for the Gateway, 5432 for PostgreSQL). In case of conflict, local services must be stopped or the configuration modified.

## 2. Obtaining the Project
The source code is obtained by cloning the official repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonas7891/ProyectoFaceAttendEDU.git
cd ProyectoFaceAttendEDU/FULL
```

## 3. System Configuration
The system configuration is centralized in a `.env` file at the project root.
1. Copy the ` .env.example` file to `.env`.
2. Adjust variables according to the environment (especially `BIND_IP` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` if accessed from mobile devices).

## 4. Deployment and Orchestration
The deployment is executed with the following command, which builds the images and launches the containers in the background:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Startup Order and Migrations
The system follows a strict dependency chain:
1. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka start.
2. **Migrations**: Eight sequential **Liquibase** tasks run to create schemas and load master data.
3. **Microservices**: Once migrations finish, the business services start.
4. **Gateway and Interface**: Finally, the Gateway (Kong) and the web interface are launched.

# Verification of the Implementation

To declare the installation as successful, the following test protocol must be executed:

| Test | Verification Method | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Container Status** | `docker compose ps` | 18 containers operational (Running/Healthy). |
| **Service Health** | `curl http://localhost:8080/health/...` | JSON response with status "UP". |
| **Gateway Connectivity** | `curl http://localhost:8080` | Response from the Kong Gateway. |
| **Authentication** | Login with `admin.faceattend` | Return of a valid session token. |
| **Interface Loading** | Access `http://localhost:8090` | Correct loading of the login screen. |
| **Network Isolation** | `docker exec ... nslookup postgres` | Resolution failure from the frontend. |

# Operation and Maintenance

## Frequent Commands
- **Restart system**: `docker compose restart`
- **View logs in real-time**: `docker compose logs -f <service>`
- **Update version**: `git pull` $\rightarrow$ `docker compose up -d --build`
- **Total cleanup (including data)**: `docker compose down -v`

## Common Troubleshooting
- **Port Occupied**: Identify the process with `netstat -ano` and terminate it or change the port in the `.env`.
- **Migration Error**: Review the `identity-liquibase` logs to detect syntax or connectivity failures.
- **Interface not connecting**: Verify that `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` matches the host IP and that the frontend has been rebuilt (`--build`).

# Conclusions

The implementation procedure for FaceAttendEDU minimizes manual intervention through Docker automation. The separation of networks and dependent orchestration ensure that the system is deployed consistently, drastically reducing "works on my machine" issues and deployment time.
