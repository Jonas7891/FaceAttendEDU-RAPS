- [ ] **AC1:** Given that an authenticated administrator accesses the color palette configuration module, when the system loads the module, then it displays the current color palettes and the option to add or modify palettes.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that the administrator selects or creates a new color palette, when the changes are saved, then the system validates the color values, stores the new palette, and reflects the changes in the application's visual behavior.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that the administrator enters invalid color values (malformed codes, out-of-range values), when the save operation is submitted, then the system rejects the operation and shows specific validation messages.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that the user attempting to configure color palettes does not have administrator permissions, when the request is processed, then the system denies access and records an unauthorized access attempt.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given that the color palette is updated successfully, when the system applies the changes, then subsequent screens and interface components reflect the new color scheme.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given that the administrator cancels the operation without saving, when the module is closed, then the system retains the previous color palette without applying changes.

- [ ] **AC7:** Given normal network conditions, when the administrator saves the color palette configuration, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

- [ ] **AC8:** Given that the color palette is updated, when the operation is completed, then the system records an audit event containing the administrator, date, and time.

---

## Technical notes

- RF 4.3 indicates that the system must validate that the user is registered and has logged into the system before allowing color palette configuration.
- RF 4.3 specifies that this is an **administrator-only** operation. Regular users, instructors, and students must not be able to modify color palettes.
- The color palette configuration should support standard color formats such as hexadecimal codes (e.g., `#RRGGBB`) or RGB values.
- The system should consider:
  - A preview functionality before saving changes.
  - Contrast validation to ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines).
  - A default palette that is applied if no custom palette is configured.
- The color palette changes should apply globally across the application or per institutional scope, depending on the team's decision.
- The team must define whether multiple palettes can coexist and how they are applied (by institution, by role, or globally).
- This story does not cover language configuration. That is handled in HU-CONF-004.
- This story does not cover alert configuration. That is handled in HU-CONF-001.

**Responsible service(s):** Configuration service / UI theme service, proposed.

# HU-CONF-006: Update user facial parameters

## Story

**As** an authenticated user or administrator  
**I want** to update my facial parameters in the system  
**So that** my facial recognition data remains accurate and up-to-date for reliable attendance registration.

---

## Acceptance criteria

> Format: "Given [context/initial state], when [user action], then [expected and verifiable result]."

- [ ] **AC1:** Given that the user is registered and has logged into the system, when the user requests a facial parameter update, then the system activates the camera and initiates the facial capture process.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that the camera is active and the user positions their face correctly, when the system captures the new facial image, then the system processes the capture and validates the new facial parameters.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that the new facial parameters are valid, when the update is saved, then the system replaces the previous facial parameters with the new ones and reflects the changes in the system's behavior.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that the facial capture fails due to lighting, movement, or camera issues, when the update attempt is processed, then the system shows a clear error message and allows the user to retry.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given that the user is not registered or has not logged into the system, when the user attempts to update facial parameters, then the system denies access and shows a clear authentication error message.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given that the facial parameter update is successful, when the system processes the change, then the system shows a confirmation message and records an audit event containing the user, date, and time.

- [ ] **AC7:** Given that the facial parameters are updated, when the user performs subsequent attendance registration, then the system uses the new facial parameters for recognition.

- [ ] **AC8:** Given that an administrator requests a facial parameter update on behalf of another user, when the administrator has appropriate permissions, then the system allows the update and records the administrator's identity in the audit event.

- [ ] **AC9:** Given normal device, camera, and network conditions, when the user completes the facial parameter update, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

---

## Technical notes

- RF 4.4 indicates that the system must validate that the user is registered and has logged into the system before allowing facial parameter updates.
- RF 4.4 specifies that this operation can be requested by the user themselves or by an administrator.
- This story complements HU-ATT-002 (initial facial parameter enrollment). The enrollment story covers the first-time registration, while this story covers updates to existing parameters.
- The facial parameter update should follow the same security and data-protection requirements as the initial enrollment:
  - Biometric data must be stored securely.
  - Facial templates or embeddings should be preferred over raw images.
  - Compliance with Colombian Law 1581 of 2012 (Habeas Data).
- The system should consider:
  - Requiring explicit user confirmation before replacing existing parameters.
  - Maintaining a backup of the previous parameters for a defined retention period.
  - Invalidating the previous parameters immediately after the update.
- The facial parameter update may require re-authentication to confirm the user's identity before proceeding.
- The system must not expose facial parameters or biometric data in logs or interface messages.
- This story does not cover initial facial enrollment. That is handled in HU-ATT-002.
- This story does not cover user activation/deactivation. That is handled in HU-IAM-007 or HU-CONF-007 depending on the SRS interpretation.

**Responsible service(s):** Configuration service / Biometric service, proposed.  
**Endpoint(s) implemented:**  
- `POST /api/v1/users/me/facial-parameters/update` — proposed, for self-service updates.  
- `POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/facial-parameters/update` — proposed, for administrator-initiated updates.  

**Events generated:**  
- `FacialParameterUpdated`  
- `FacialParameterUpdateFailed`  
- `UnauthorizedFacialParameterUpdateAttempt`  

**Required permissions:**  
- Authenticated user for self-service updates.  
- Administrator or Supervisor for updates on behalf of other users.

# HU-CONF-007: IoT device failure alerts management

## Story

**As** an administrator or supervisor  
**I want** to receive alerts when IoT devices used for attendance registration experience failures  
**So that** I can take timely corrective actions and maintain the availability of the attendance registration system.

---

## Acceptance criteria

> Format: "Given [context/initial state], when [user action], then [expected and verifiable result]."

- [ ] **AC1:** Given that an IoT device registered in the system detects a failure (camera malfunction, connectivity loss, hardware error), when the failure is detected, then the system generates an alert and notifies the configured administrators or supervisors.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that an IoT device failure alert is generated, when the administrator accesses the alert management module, then the system displays the alert with device information, failure type, date, and time.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that the administrator acknowledges the alert, when the acknowledgment is processed, then the system marks the alert as acknowledged and records the administrator's identity and timestamp.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that the administrator resolves the device failure, when the resolution is recorded, then the system marks the alert as resolved and updates the device status accordingly.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given that an IoT device reconnects or recovers automatically, when the system detects the recovery, then the system updates the device status and closes any open alerts associated with that device.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given that the user attempting to access the alert management module does not have administrator or supervisor permissions, when the request is processed, then the system denies access and records an unauthorized access attempt.

- [ ] **AC7:** Given normal network conditions, when the administrator accesses or manages IoT device alerts, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

- [ ] **AC8:** Given that an IoT device failure alert is generated, when the operation is completed, then the system records an audit event containing the device, failure type, date, and time.

---

## Technical notes

- ⚠️ **SRS Inconsistency Note:** The SRS index lists RF 4.5 as "Gestión de alertas de fallos de dispositivos IoT" [IoT device failure alert management], but the detailed RF 4.5 section describes "Desactivar y reactivar usuarios" [Deactivate and reactivate users]. This story is documented based on the **index description** (IoT device failure alerts). The user activation/deactivation functionality is covered in HU-IAM-007 (RF 1.6). This inconsistency should be validated with the instructor.
- The IoT device failure alerts management should consider:
  - Device types: cameras, sensors, or other hardware used for attendance registration.
  - Failure types: connectivity loss, hardware malfunction, camera failure, low battery (if applicable).
  - Alert severity levels: informational, warning, critical.
- The alert notification mechanism should integrate with the notification service defined in HU-CONF-001 and HU-JUS-003.
- The system should consider:
  - Automatic health checks for registered IoT devices.
  - Configurable alert thresholds (e.g., alert after N consecutive failures).
  - Alert escalation for unresolved critical failures.
- The device status should be updated in real-time or near-real-time.
- The system should maintain a device registry with information such as device ID, location/environment, status, and last activity timestamp.
- This story does not cover user activation/deactivation. That is handled in HU-IAM-007.
- The team must define the specific IoT device types and failure detection mechanisms.

**Responsible service(s):** Configuration service / IoT monitoring service, proposed.  
**Endpoint(s) implemented:**  
- `GET /api/v1/iot-devices/alerts` — proposed, returns IoT device failure alerts.  
- `PATCH /api/v1/iot-devices/alerts/{alertId}/acknowledge` — proposed, acknowledges an alert.  
- `PATCH /api/v1/iot-devices/alerts/{alertId}/resolve` — proposed, resolves an alert.  
- `GET /api/v1/iot-devices` — proposed, returns device registry with status.  

**Events generated:**  
- `IoTDeviceFailureDetected`  
- `IoTDeviceAlertAcknowledged`  
- `IoTDeviceAlertResolved`  
- `IoTDeviceRecovered`  
- `UnauthorizedIoTAlertAccessAttempt`  

**Required permissions:**  
- Administrator or Supervisor for alert management.  
- Regular users, instructors, and students must not access IoT device alerts.

# HU-CONF-008: Delay and justification parametrization

## Story

**As** an administrator  
**I want** to configure which excuses or justifications are valid for supporting absences or delays  
**So that** the justification evaluation process follows institutional criteria and ensures consistent treatment of all student cases.

---

## Acceptance criteria

> Format: "Given [context/initial state], when [user action], then [expected and verifiable result]."

- [ ] **AC1:** Given that an authenticated administrator accesses the delay and justification parametrization module, when the system loads the module, then it displays the list of currently configured valid justifications and the option to add, modify, or remove parameters.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that the administrator adds a new valid justification parameter, when the save operation is submitted, then the system validates that the parameter does not already exist in the system and stores the new justification type.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that the justification parameter already exists in the system, when the administrator attempts to add it again, then the system rejects the operation and shows a clear error message indicating that the parameter is already defined.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that the administrator modifies an existing justification parameter, when the changes are saved, then the system updates the parameter and reflects the changes in subsequent justification evaluations.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given that the administrator removes a justification parameter, when the removal is confirmed, then the system deactivates the parameter and it is no longer considered valid for new justification evaluations.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given that the user attempting to access the parametrization module does not have administrator permissions, when the request is processed, then the system denies access and records an unauthorized access attempt.

- [ ] **AC7:** Given that a justification parameter is configured, when a student submits a justification in HU-JUS-001, then the system uses the configured parameters to determine if the justification is valid during evaluation in HU-JUS-002.

- [ ] **AC8:** Given normal network conditions, when the administrator saves the parametrization changes, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

- [ ] **AC9:** Given that a justification parameter is added, modified, or removed, when the operation is completed, then the system records an audit event containing the administrator, action type, parameter details, date, and time.

---

## Technical notes

- RF 4.7 indicates that the system must validate that the configured parameter is not already defined in the system.
- RF 4.7 specifies that this is an **administrator-only** operation for defining valid justifications.
- The justification parametrization should consider:
  - Justification type name (e.g., medical certificate, family emergency, institutional activity).
  - Whether a supporting document is required.
  - Whether the justification applies to absences, delays, or both.
  - Maximum validity period (e.g., justification must be submitted within N days).
  - Whether the justification requires approval from a specific role.
- The configured parameters are used by:
  - HU-JUS-001: To validate that the submitted justification matches a valid type.
  - HU-JUS-002: To determine if the justification is valid during evaluation.
  - HU-REP-004: To filter and report delays and absences by justification status.
- The system should consider:
  - Preventing removal of justification parameters that are actively used in pending justifications.
  - Maintaining a historical record of parameter changes for audit purposes.
  - Providing default justification types for initial setup.
- The team must define whether justification parameters are institution-specific or global.
- This story does not cover the justification submission process. That is handled in HU-JUS-001.
- This story does not cover the justification evaluation process. That is handled in HU-JUS-002.
- This story does not cover delay detection. That is handled in HU-ATT-001.

**Responsible service(s):** Configuration service / Justification parametrization service, proposed.
