# HU-ACAD-001: Register environments/classrooms

## Story

**As** an administrator or supervisor  
**I want** to register environments or classrooms  
**So that** attendance records can be associated with the correct training space where students attend class.

---

## Acceptance criteria

> Format: “Given [context/initial state], when [user action], then [expected and verifiable result].”

- [ ] **AC1:** Given that an administrator or supervisor is authenticated in the system, when the user submits valid environment identifiers, then the system validates the data, registers the environment/classroom, stores the information securely, and shows a confirmation message.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that the environment data is incomplete or invalid, when the registration is submitted, then the system rejects the operation and shows specific validation messages.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that an environment with the same unique identifier already exists, when the administrator attempts to register it again, then the system prevents duplicate registration and shows a clear error message.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that an environment is successfully registered, when the system requires an environment for attendance registration or reporting, then the registered environment is available for selection.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given normal network conditions, when the administrator registers an environment, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given that an environment is registered, when the operation is completed, then the system records an audit event containing the action, user, date, and time.

---

## Technical notes

- The SRS refers to environments as “ambientes/salones”, which are the physical or virtual spaces where attendance is recorded.
- Environment data must be validated before persistence, according to RF 2.1 acceptance criteria.
- The information must be stored securely, according to RF 2.1 and RNF 4.
- This story does not include assignment of schedules, cohorts, or instructors. Those relationships are handled in other ACAD stories.
- The environment entity will be used later by attendance registration, reports, and dashboards.
- The user interface should allow consulting registered environments after creation.
- Auditability is recommended for administrative changes.

# HU-ACAD-002: Register cohorts/courses

## Story

**As** an administrator or supervisor  
**I want** to register cohorts or courses, known as “fichas” in the SENA context  
**So that** student groups can be associated with attendance control, responsible instructors, and training schedules.

---

## Acceptance criteria

> Format: “Given [context/initial state], when [user action], then [expected and verifiable result].”

- [ ] **AC1:** Given that an administrator or supervisor is authenticated in the system, when the user submits valid cohort/course identifiers, then the system validates the data, registers the cohort/course associated with attendance control, stores the information securely, and shows a confirmation message.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that the cohort/course data is incomplete or invalid, when the registration is submitted, then the system rejects the operation and shows specific validation messages.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that a cohort/course with the same unique identifier already exists, when the administrator attempts to register it again, then the system prevents duplicate registration and shows a clear error message.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that a cohort/course is successfully registered, when attendance registration or academic assignment is performed, then the system can display or use the cohort/course associated with the corresponding user or training group, according to RF 2.2.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given that a cohort/course is successfully registered, when the administrator assigns responsible instructors or schedules, then the cohort/course is available for those relationships.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given normal network conditions, when the administrator registers a cohort/course, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

- [ ] **AC7:** Given that a cohort/course is registered, when the operation is completed, then the system records an audit event containing the action, user, date, and time.

---

## Technical notes

- The SRS uses the terms “fichas/cursos”. The team must define whether a “ficha” is treated as a cohort, group, or course in the final domain model.
- This story covers the registration of the group/cohort, not the assignment of students, instructors, or schedules.
- The registered cohort/course must be available for later assignment of responsible users, according to RF 2.3.1.
- The cohort/course entity will be used by attendance registration, history queries, justifications, and reports.
- Validation rules should include required identifiers and institutional context.
- Sensitive data is not expected in this entity, but administrative changes should be auditable.
- The system should store data securely, according to RF 2.2 and RNF 4.

**Responsible service(s):** Academic Structure service, proposed.  
**Endpoint(s) implemented:**  
- `POST /api/v1/cohorts` — proposed, representing SENA “fichas”.  
- `GET /api/v1/cohorts` — proposed.  

**Events generated:**  
- `CohortRegistered`  
- `CohortRegistrationFailed`  

**Required permissions:**  
- Administrator or Supervisor.

# HU-ACAD-003: Assign responsible instructors

## Story

**As** an administrator or supervisor  
**I want** to assign a teacher/instructor as the responsible user for a cohort or training block  
**So that** attendance records are linked to the correct instructor and instructors can view the groups assigned to them.

---

## Acceptance criteria

> Format: “Given [context/initial state], when [user action], then [expected and verifiable result].”

- [ ] **AC1:** Given that an administrator or supervisor has logged into FaceAttend EDU and users are registered in the system, when the user accesses the responsible assignment function, then the system shows the list of users associated with the administrator and the list of users of type teacher/instructor, according to RF 2.3.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that a valid teacher/instructor and a registered cohort/course are selected, when the administrator assigns the responsible user, then the system associates the instructor with the cohort/course or training block and shows a confirmation message.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that the selected user is not a valid user or is not of type teacher/instructor, when the administrator attempts the assignment, then the system rejects the operation and shows a validation error.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that the cohort/course does not exist in the system, when the administrator attempts to assign a responsible user, then the system rejects the operation and shows a validation error.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given that a responsible instructor is successfully assigned, when attendance is registered for the corresponding cohort or training block, then the system can identify the instructor responsible for that attendance record.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given normal network conditions, when the administrator assigns a responsible instructor, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

- [ ] **AC7:** Given that a responsible instructor is assigned or updated, when the operation is completed, then the system records an audit event containing the action, administrator, instructor, cohort/course, date, and time.

---

## Technical notes

- The SRS describes this requirement as obtaining the teacher/instructor responsible for the training block corresponding to attendance registration.
- The assignment must require prior login and prior registration in FaceAttend EDU, according to RF 2.3 acceptance criteria.
- The system must show both:
  - Users associated with the administrator.
  - Users of type teacher/instructor.
- This story does not yet include assignment of time blocks or schedules. That is covered in HU-ACAD-005.
- The responsible instructor relationship will be used by attendance, history, reports, and dashboards.
- The system should prevent assigning responsibility to users without an instructor/teacher role.
- Auditability is recommended because this assignment affects academic visibility and reporting permissions.
- The team should define whether a cohort/course can have one or multiple responsible instructors.

**Responsible service(s):** Academic Structure service, proposed.  
**Endpoint(s) implemented:**  
- `GET /api/v1/users?role=instructor` — proposed.  
- `POST /api/v1/cohorts/{cohortId}/responsible` — proposed.  
- `GET /api/v1/cohorts/{cohortId}/responsible` — proposed.  

**Events generated:**

# HU-ACAD-004: Assign cohorts to responsible users

## Story

**As** an administrator or supervisor  
**I want** to assign registered cohorts/courses, known as “fichas”, to a valid responsible user  
**So that** administrative users, instructors, and responsible users can view and manage the cohorts assigned to their academic responsibility.

---

## Acceptance criteria

> Format: “Given [context/initial state], when [user action], then [expected and verifiable result].”

- [ ] **AC1:** Given that an administrator or supervisor is authenticated in the system, when the user selects a valid responsible user and an existing cohort/course, then the system associates the cohort/course with the responsible user and shows a confirmation message.

- [ ] **AC2:** Given that the selected responsible user is not a valid registered user, when the assignment is submitted, then the system rejects the operation and shows a validation error.

- [ ] **AC3:** Given that the selected cohort/course does not exist in the system, when the assignment is submitted, then the system rejects the operation and shows a validation error.

- [ ] **AC4:** Given that a responsible user has assigned cohorts/courses, when the user requests the list of cohorts under their responsibility, then the system displays the cohorts corresponding to their assigned responsibility, according to RF 2.3.1.

- [ ] **AC5:** Given that an administrative user, supervisor, administrator, or teacher/instructor accesses the cohort assignment module, when the system loads the information, then the user sees only the cohorts allowed by their role.

- [ ] **AC6:** Given normal network conditions, when the administrator assigns or consults cohorts for a responsible user, then the system responds in less than 5 seconds, according to RNF 1.

- [ ] **AC7:** Given that a cohort/course is assigned to a responsible user, when the operation is completed, then the system records an audit event containing the action, user, responsible user, cohort/course, date, and time.

---

## Technical notes

- The SRS indicates that administrative users (Supervisor, Administrator, and Teacher/Instructor) must be able to obtain the list of cohorts corresponding to their work.
- The system must validate that the responsible user is valid and that the cohort/course exists, according to RF 2.3.1 acceptance criteria.
- This story complements HU-ACAD-003 by formalizing the visibility and association of cohorts assigned to a responsible user.
- The responsible-cohort relationship will be used by attendance registration, history, reports, dashboards, and instructor permissions.
- The system should define whether a responsible user can have one or multiple cohorts assigned.
- The system should prevent assigning inactive users as responsible users.
- Role-based access must be enforced on the server side.
- Auditability is recommended because this assignment affects academic visibility and reporting permissions.
