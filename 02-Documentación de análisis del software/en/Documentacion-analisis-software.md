# Introduction

The software analysis documentation for the FaceAttendEDU system allows for an understanding of the problem, the context, and the conditions necessary for the technological solution to generate real value. In this project, the analysis is critical as it integrates human processes, regulatory constraints, information security, and attendance traceability.

The system focuses on the management of users, environments, courses, attendance records, and advanced reports, starting from a situation of fragmented processes and security risks. This document establishes the objectives, delimits the scope, and provides a verifiable base for requirements specification and architectural design, reducing ambiguity and aligning stakeholder expectations.

## Document Objective
Formally analyze the context, objectives, scope, and feasibility of the project to guide the requirements specification, design, implementation, and continuous improvement.

## Document Scope
This document covers the strategic analysis of the system (problem, objectives, risks, and success criteria). It does not replace the requirements specification report or the detailed architectural design.

# Project Context

## General System Description

The system is a platform composed of an administrative web application and an operational mobile application. Its purpose is to digitize and control processes related to users' digital identity, role and permission assignment, academic environment management, attendance recording, control of unregistered personnel, parameterization of lateness and justification rules, generation of histories, production of reports, and administration of the school's academic catalog.

The solution relies on authentication, biometrics, notifications, document management, auditing, analytical reports, and IoT device monitoring components. By its nature, it requires robust security, privacy, usability, traceability, and availability controls.

## Current Situation

Before the implementation of the system, or during its initial development phase, the following conditions are identified:

- Manual, semi-manual, or dispersed attendance recording processes in non-integrated tools.
- Difficulty in consulting histories immediately and reliably.
- Risk of human errors in typing, duplication, omission, or manipulation of records.
- Lack of comprehensive visibility over lateness, absences, and justifications.
- Inconsistencies between the mobile interface, approved mockups, and actual development progress.
- Presence of functional defects in mobile navigation and date selection.
- Insufficient management of roles, permissions, and segregation of duties.
- Need to strengthen security protocols to prevent forgery, impersonation, or unauthorized access.
- Absence or weakness in traceable audit mechanisms.
- Difficulty in generating reliable reports for decision-making.

## Central Problem

The central problem can be formulated as follows:

> The organization lacks an integrated, secure, traceable, and usable system to manage users, academic environments, attendance, justifications, reports, and operational configuration, which increases the risk of errors, inconsistencies, unauthorized access, administrative delays, and low quality in decision-making.

## Desired Situation

The desired situation consists of having a platform that allows:

- Registering and managing users with clearly defined roles and permissions.
- Secure authentication on web and mobile.
- Controlling environments, courses, supervisors, and shifts.
- Recording entries and exits with biometric support and controlled alternative methods.
- Handling unregistered personnel through supervised and temporary processes.
- Configuring alerts, language, palettes, and personal parameters on mobile.
- Monitoring IoT device failures.
- Parameterizing lateness and justification rules with versioning.
- Consulting histories and change audits.
- Uploading, approving, or rejecting justifications with automatic notification.
- Generating advanced reports, dashboards, and secure exports.
- Managing the school's courses and curricula.

## Analyzed Gap

| Dimension | Current State | Desired State | Main Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity Management | Incomplete or poorly visible users, roles, and permissions | Clear, audited RBAC model applied on the server | Lack of full roles and permissions implementation |
| Attendance | Dispersed, manual, or error-prone records | Biometric or alternative registration with traceability | Need for a reliable, secure, and verifiable flow |
| Mobile | Date errors, inconsistent navigation, and misaligned mockup | Fluid experience, consistent with approved design | Correction of defects and design-development alignment |
| Security | Risk of forgery, impersonation, or unauthorized access | Preventive controls, robust authentication, and auditing | Strengthen protocols and security questions |
| Reports | Information difficult to consolidate | Dashboards, exports, and parameter-based queries | Build a reliable and secure analytical layer |
| Governance | Decisions based on incomplete data | Traceability, indicators, and periodic review | Institutionalize analysis, CAPA, and continuous improvement |

# Contribution of Analysis to Project Creation

Software analysis transforms vague needs into actionable and verifiable artifacts, adding value in the following dimensions:

- **Reduction of Ambiguity:** Breaks down general statements (e.g., "manage users") into specific requirements (registration, roles, authentication), avoiding divergent interpretations.
- **Prioritization and Criteria:** Allows distinguishing critical functionalities and associating them with objective compliance conditions, facilitating testing and acceptance.
- **Risk Identification:** Exposes technical and privacy risks early, reducing the cost of correction.
- **Design-Development Alignment:** Corrects deviations between mockups and the frontend before they become technical debt.
- **Security by Design:** Incorporates controls from conception (server-side RBAC, biometric encryption, auditing).
- **Traceability and Improvement:** Links findings with requirements and corrective actions (CAPA), fundamental for auditing.

| Activity | Analysis Contribution | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements Gathering | Clarifies problem and context | Precise requirements |
| Scope Definition | Delimits included and excluded | Avoids "scope creep" |
| Flow Design | Identifies actors and exceptions | Robust processes |

3. Biometric registration requires privacy controls, liveness detection, alternative methods, and robust auditing.
4. The mobile application requires priority correction of navigation, date fields, and alignment with mockups.
5. Security must include recovery questions, anti-forgery protocols, session protection, and server-side validation.
6. Reports and dashboards must respect the scope per supervisor to avoid information leakage.
7. Parameterization of lateness and justifications must be versioned to avoid corrupting histories.
8. CSV import represents a security and privacy risk if not properly sanitized and controlled.
9. The analysis must connect with corrective, preventive, and improvement actions to close the quality cycle.
10. Analytical documentation reduces ambiguity and serves as a contractual, technical, and audit base.

# Traceability with Other Artifacts

| Artifact | Relationship with this Document | Expected Use |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements Specification Report | Derives from the objectives, scope, and findings analyzed | Convert analysis into verifiable requirements |
| Corrective, Preventive, and Improvement Action Table | Receives identified findings and risks | Manage continuous improvement |
| Test Plan | Uses acceptance criteria and edge cases | Verify compliance |
| Risk Register | Feeds mitigations and tracking | Project governance |
| RBAC Matrix | Derives from the need for roles and permissions | Access control |
| Privacy Policy | Derives from the treatment of biometric and personal data | Compliance |
| Release Notes and Backlog | Convert analysis into prioritized deliverables | Agile execution |

# Expected Value Analysis

The system generates value in four main dimensions:

1. **Operational:** Reduces registration and information consolidation time, decreasing daily friction and manual errors.
2. **Risk:** Prevents unauthorized access, impersonation, and loss of traceability. The value is preventive and evidenced by the reduction of incidents.
3. **Decisional:** Allows moving from intuitive decisions to data-driven decisions through dashboards and analytical reports.
4. **Institutional:** Strengthens organizational maturity by institutionalizing software quality and traceability as recurrent practices.

# Recommended Approach for the Next Phase

The next phase should be the formal specification of requirements, already initiated in the Requirements Specification Report. To maintain coherence, it is recommended to:

1. Freeze the minimum viable scope based on critical risks.
2. Prioritize RF 1, RF 3, RF 4.7, RF 5, and RF 6 as the operational core.
3. Treat RF 7 as an analytical layer dependent on data quality.
4. Implement RF 8 as a master catalog necessary for courses and plans.
5. Link each ERF with test cases, responsible party, commitment date, and evidence.
6. Open a CAPA file for mobile, security, and design findings.
7. Validate with key users before mass deployment.

# Ethical, Privacy, and Responsibility Considerations

The use of biometrics, personal data, and access controls requires an ethical and legal approach. The system must not be implemented as a disproportionate surveillance mechanism or as an arbitrary sanction tool. It must respect principles of legitimacy, purpose, minimization, accuracy, security, transparency, and proactive responsibility.

In particular:
- Biometrics must be used only when there is a real need and a suitable legal basis.
- Users must be clearly informed about the treatment of their data.
- Reasonable alternatives must exist when biometrics fail or are not desirable.
- Records must be kept for defined periods and deleted or anonymized when appropriate.
- Access to sensitive information must be audited and limited by role.
- Alerts and reports must not be used for discrimination or abusive control.

# Conclusions

The Software Analysis Documentation serves a structural function in the project life cycle: it transforms an operational need into a comprehensible, prioritized, verifiable, and governable framework. In this case, the analysis confirms that the system is pertinent, viable, and of high value, provided that security, privacy, mobile usability, traceability, and data quality are properly managed.

The project objectives are oriented towards digitizing, controlling, and auditing critical academic and administrative management processes. The scope is delimited by clear functional modules, explicit exclusions, and analytical limits. The project was undertaken because of the need to reduce errors, strengthen security, and improve decisions; it serves to automate processes, provide traceability, and enable reports; and it has the strategic purpose of institutionalizing quality, trust, and continuous improvement.

Likewise, the analysis helps during project creation by reducing ambiguity, prioritizing efforts, preventing risks, aligning stakeholders, grounding tests, and sustaining documentary traceability. The main beneficiaries are school direction, academic supervisors, registered personnel, administrative areas, IT, quality, security, and privacy, without neglecting indirect benefits for visitors, the educational community, and future system scalability.

This document should be considered a living base. Its value increases when connected to the requirements specification, the backlog, test cases, the risk register, and corrective, preventive, and improvement actions. In this way, the analysis is not a static artifact, but an engineering and governance mechanism for building robust, secure, and useful software.
