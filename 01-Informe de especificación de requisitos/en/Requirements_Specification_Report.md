# Introduction

The system described in this report supports the integral management of users, environments or classrooms, cohorts or courses, entry and exit records, mobile configurations, attendance histories, justifications, analytical reports, and the administration of the school's academic catalog. The functional requirements derive from the list provided by the product area and are detailed here as verifiable specifications, aligned with requirements engineering best practices (International Organization for Standardization, International Electrotechnical Commission, & Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers [ISO, IEC, & IEEE], 2018).

From a software quality perspective, each requirement must be unambiguous, complete, consistent, verifiable, and traceable. Therefore, this document does not limit itself to repeating RF and ERF identifiers, but defines input conditions, processing, output, business rules, permissions, audit events, acceptance criteria, and edge cases. This structure reduces ambiguity during development, facilitates automated testing, and supports internal or external audits.

The presentation follows hierarchical organization principles, author-date citation, and verifiable references, consistent with the seventh edition of the APA Standards (American Psychological Association [APA], 2020). In Markdown, visual fidelity of line spacing, margins, hanging indents, and typography must be guaranteed in the final export to `.docx` or `.pdf`.

## Objective

# System Actors

| Actor | Description | Main Interaction |
|---|---|---|
| General Administrator | User with broad configuration and management privileges | Manages users, roles, permissions, courses, parameters, and global reports |
| Academic Responsible | Instructor assigned to cohorts or environments | Manages attendance, justifications, and queries within their scope |
| Registered Personnel | Authorized school user | Consults their profile, marks attendance, and presents justifications |
| Unregistered Personnel | Visitor, contractor, or temporary person | Enters via supervised alternative registration |
| Mobile Application | Client used on mobile devices | Authentication, facial registration, fingerprint, alerts, configuration, and queries |
| Web Platform | Administrative and query interface | Master management, CSV import, reports, and auditing |
| IoT Devices | Connected sensors, controllers, or peripherals | Send state, failures, and operation events |
| Notification Service | Technical messaging component | Delivers push, email, or SMS according to configuration |
| Auditor or Quality | Supervision role | Reviews traceability, evidence, and regulatory compliance |

# Premises and Restrictions

## Premises

- Registered users possess unique credentials or a valid identity document.
- Mobile devices support a front camera and, optionally, a fingerprint sensor.
- The mobile application requires operating system permissions for camera, biometrics, notifications, and storage when applicable.
- A base catalog of courses, environments, cohorts, and shifts exists before critical attendance operation.
- Assigned responsibles have a current contractual or labor relationship with the school.

## Restrictions

- Biometric data storage must comply with principles of minimization, security, consent, and defined retention.
- Authorization must be applied on the server; hiding menus in the interface is not sufficient security control.
- CSV import must mitigate risks of formula injection and personal data exposure.
- Reports must respect the principle of least privilege according to the assigned role and scope.
- Critical security or IoT failure alerts should not be completely disableable by the end user, unless an explicitly approved policy exists.
- Changes in roles, user status, and delay parameterization must be audited.

# Transversal Acceptance Criteria

Every functional requirement described in this report must meet, at minimum, the following transversal criteria:

1. Input validation on both client and server.
2. Prior authentication when the requirement involves personal or administrative data.
3. Role and permission-based authorization, with denial by default.
4. Clear error messages, without leaking sensitive information.
5. Audit logging for creative, modificative, eliminatory, authentication, and status change operations.
6. Protection of personal and biometric data through encryption in transit and at rest.
7. Traceability between interface, API, database, and deployment evidence.
8. Unit, integration, and edge-case test cases associated with the requirement.
9. Deterministic behavior under slow networks, expired sessions, denied permissions, and inconsistent data.
10. Basic accessibility: legible contrast, clear labels, and keyboard navigation on web.

# Security and Privacy Considerations

## Biometric Data

Biometric data are sensitive categories. The system must:
- Obtain informed consent when applicable.
- Store encrypted templates, not raw images unless technically justified and approved.
- Limit access to templates through service segregation.
- Define secure retention and deletion upon user departure or consent revocation.
- Register failed biometric authentication attempts without exposing sensitive data in logs.
- Evaluate risk of algorithmic bias and false negatives due to physical or environmental conditions.

## Authentication and Sessions

- Strong hashing for passwords, e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, or scrypt according to adopted standard.
- MFA for critical roles if risk justifies it.
- Session revocation upon password, role, or status change.
- Protection against brute force and credential stuffing.

## Import and Export

- Validate real MIME type, not just extension.
- Scan files for malware.
- Prevent CSV injection by prepending a secure character to risk fields.
- Limit report downloads to authorized users.
- Register export audit with used filters.

## IoT

- Unique credentials per device.
- Periodic rotation.
- Encrypted communication.
- Network segmentation.
- Monitoring of anomalies and vulnerable firmware.

# Conclusions

This report transforms the initial list of functional requirements into a verifiable technical specification. Each RF and ERF was broken down with purpose, platform, rules, acceptance criteria, security, edge cases, and associated tests. This structure allows for reducing ambiguity, aligning development and QA, protecting sensitive data, and sustaining traceability for audits.

The most critical points of the system are: secure management of roles and permissions, reliable biometric registration, control of unregistered personnel, consistent parameterization of delays and justifications, and reports that respect the scope of the responsible party. Ignoring these aspects can lead to false attendance, data exposure, historical inconsistencies, or operational dysfunction.

For production implementation, it is recommended to validate this report with product, security, privacy, quality, and key user areas before freezing the scope. Subsequently, each ERF must be traced to epics, user stories, test cases, commits, pipelines, and deployment evidence.
