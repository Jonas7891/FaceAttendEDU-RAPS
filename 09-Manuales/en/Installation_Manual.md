# Version Control

Every modification to this manual must be recorded before the document is submitted again. The record makes it possible to determine whether the manual corresponds to the version of the software being installed.

**Table 1**

*Document version history*

| **Version** | **Date**   | **Description of change**                                                                                                                                                                      | **Responsible**  |

| 1.0         | 06/10/2026 | Initial creation of the installation manual. Documents the deployment of the full set of 18 containers, configuration by means of the single environment file, the chain of versioned migrations, and the verification procedure. | Development team |
| 1.1         | 06/10/2026 | Application of the APA standards in their 7th edition and alignment with the common structure of the project manuals.                                                                           | Development team |

*Note.* Minor changes, such as wording adjustments or the addition of screenshots, increment the second digit; changes that alter the installation procedure increment the first.

## Update Rule

The manual must be reviewed after every deployment that modifies the services, the ports, the environment variables, or the versions of the required tools.

> • Every addition of a new service to the container set requires updating the system description, the port map, and the verification procedure.
>
> • Every new environment variable must be documented in the initial configuration section before submission.
>
> • Every delivered version must be recorded in the table above together with its responsible party.

# Introduction

FaceAttend EDU is a web and mobile platform intended for attendance management in educational institutions. The system automates check-in and check-out recording by means of facial recognition, retains a manual recording alternative, centralizes the attendance history, and manages the justification workflows, the role-differentiated reports, and the alerts addressed to the academic stakeholders.

This document explains, step by step, how to prepare the environment, configure the dependencies, and bring the system into operation on a local machine or on a server, starting from a machine with no prior installation.

The system does not constitute a single program, but rather a set of nine independent services, implemented in four different programming languages, which are deployed in a coordinated manner together with a gateway, three storage engines, and a messaging broker. For this reason, the installation procedure relies on containers, a mechanism that allows the entire set to be deployed with a single command.

All of the technical information set out here — ports, service names, configuration variables, paths, and initial credentials — corresponds to the configuration verified in the project repository.

Table 2 delimits the function of this document in relation to the other three manuals that make up the project documentation.

# Installer Profile

The document is addressed to the technician or the person responsible for bringing the system up: the instructor who deploys it for assessment purposes, the team member who sets up their workstation, or the systems administrator who installs it on an institutional server.

## Required Knowledge

The reader is assumed to know how to open a terminal and run commands. No prior knowledge of containers, of microservice architectures, or of any of the programming languages used in the project is assumed: the necessary information is presented in the document itself and the technical terms are defined in the Glossary section.

## Installer Responsibilities

> • Verify that all of the prerequisites are met before downloading the project.
>
> • Keep the configuration file outside the repository and replace the development credentials when the installation becomes accessible to third parties.
>
> • Run the complete verification protocol before declaring the installation finished.
>
> • Document, using the format in Appendix D, any incident that is not resolved by the Troubleshooting section.
>
> • Hand over to the system administrator the initial credentials and warn them of the obligation to change them.

## Limits of the Role

The installer does not administer the system once it is deployed. The creation of real users, the assignment of roles, the configuration of the academic parameters, and the generation of reports are the responsibility of the administrator and are described in their own manual. Neither does the installer modify the source code: when the procedure fails because of a software defect, their responsibility is to report it, not to fix it.

# General System Description

It is worth understanding the nature of what is to be installed before starting the procedure.

## Nature of the Installation

The system is built on a microservice architecture. Instead of a single large program, it is composed of nine independent services, each responsible for a delimited portion of the business: identity, authorization, academic management, scheduling, attendance, biometrics, configuration, notifications, and quality. In front of them operates a gateway that receives all of the requests and directs them to the corresponding service; behind them sit the databases and the messaging broker.

Installing this set manually would be unfeasible, since each service is implemented in a different programming language — Java, TypeScript, Python, and Go — and has its own dependencies. For this reason, the project uses containers, a mechanism that packages each service together with all of its runtime requirements (Docker Inc., n.d.-a), and an orchestration tool that deploys the eighteen containers in the correct order with a single command (Docker Inc., n.d.-b).

The practical consequence of this decision is relevant for the installer: there is no need to install Java, Node.js, Python, or Go on the machine, since the container platform downloads and runs them inside each container. Only Docker and Git are required. Manual installation of the languages is described in the Installation Without Containers section and is only necessary when the source code is to be modified.

## System Components

The complete deployment brings up eighteen containers, grouped into three layers. Tables 3, 4, and 5 detail the components of the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data layer, respectively.

| Migrations (eight)   | Liquibase 4.29 | Not applicable | Temporary tasks that create the tables and load the initial data; they run, finish, and stop            |

## Network Organization

The containers are distributed across three networks isolated from one another. The purpose of this separation is for the data layer to be unreachable from the network that serves the browser. Figure 1 represents this organization.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

*Note.* Only ports 8080, intended for the application programming interface, and 8090, intended for the web interface, remain open to the outside. The remainder listen exclusively on the loopback address 127.0.0.1, in accordance with the value of the BIND_IP variable.

For the installer, this organization means that, once the system is deployed, only two addresses are needed: http://localhost:8090 for the graphical interface and http://localhost:8080 for the application programming interface. The databases are not exposed and must not be opened to the outside.

# Prerequisites

All of the requirements in this section must be verified before downloading the project. An unmet requirement causes failures that are difficult to diagnose at later stages of the procedure.

## Hardware Requirements

The deployment brings up eighteen simultaneous containers, four of which run a Java virtual machine. Memory consumption is therefore considerable, and it is the requirement that is most frequently not met.

**Table 6**

*Minimum and recommended hardware requirements*

| **Resource**        | **Minimum**         | **Recommended**  | **Remark**                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Random access memory| 8 GB                | 16 GB            | With 8 GB the system starts, although it is advisable to close the other applications. At least 6 GB must be allocated to the container platform |
| Processor           | Four cores          | Eight cores      | Must support hardware virtualization and have it enabled in the basic input/output system                                        |
| Disk space          | 20 GB free          | 30 GB free       | Container images, source code, dependencies, and data volumes                                                                   |
| Network connection  | Internet access     | Broadband        | Needed only during the first build, to download approximately 5 GB                                                              |

*Note.* The memory values were estimated from the number of deployed containers and the characteristic consumption of the four Java virtual machines that make up the system.

**Warning.** The container platform does not work when hardware virtualization is disabled. On Windows, this condition is checked in Task Manager, Performance tab, CPU section, where it must read "Virtualization: Enabled". Otherwise, it must be enabled in the machine's basic input/output system, under the designations Intel VT-x, SVM Mode, or Virtualization Technology, depending on the manufacturer.

## Operating System

**Table 7**

*Supported operating systems*

| **Operating system**    | **Minimum version**     | **Remark**                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows 10 and Windows 11 | Build 19044, 64-bit   | Requires the Windows Subsystem for Linux in its second version, which is installed together with the container platform |
| Ubuntu                  | 22.04 LTS               | Requires the container engine and the orchestration plugin. Debian 12 and Fedora 39 are equally supported        |
| macOS                   | 13 (Ventura)            | Compatible with Intel processors and with Apple Silicon architecture processors                                  |

## Required Software

Only two tools are required, since the container platform provides the rest of the runtime environment.

| **Tool**        | **Minimum version** | **Source**                  | **Verification command**  | **Purpose**                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Docker          | 24.0                | docker.com                  | docker --version          | Run each service in its own container             |
| Docker Compose  | 2.20                | Included in Docker Desktop  | docker compose version    | Deploy and coordinate the eighteen containers     |
| Git             | 2.40                | git-scm.com                 | git --version             | Download the source code from the repository      |

**Note.** The orchestration tool supports two invocation forms. Current versions use `docker compose`, in two words, since it is a Docker subcommand; earlier versions used `docker-compose`, with a hyphen, since it was a standalone program. This manual always uses the current form. If the machine only recognizes the hyphenated form, the platform must be updated: the project uses the *include* directive, which requires version 2.20 or higher.

## Optional Tools

The tools listed below are not necessary for the installation, but they facilitate later review and diagnostic tasks.

**Table 9**

*Complementary support tools*

| **Tool**            | **Situation of use**                               | **Function**                                              |

## Port Availability

The system requires fifteen free ports. When one of them is occupied by another program, the corresponding container does not start.

**Table 10**

*Required ports and frequent conflicts*

| **Port**     | **Service**                | **Exposure**         | **Frequent conflict**                                                      |

### Checking the Availability of a Port

On Windows, using the command interpreter or PowerShell, the following instruction is used, replacing the number with the port to be checked:

> netstat -ano | findstr ":5432"

On Linux and macOS the following instruction is used:

> lsof -i :5432

**Verification.** When the command returns no lines, the port is free. When it returns one or more lines, the port is occupied: the program must be identified and stopped, or else the port must be changed in the configuration file, as explained in the Initial Configuration section.

## Network Connectivity

During the first installation, the machine downloads container images and dependencies from the internet. If working behind a corporate proxy server or a restrictive firewall, access must be ensured to the following domains:

> • hub.docker.com and the docker.io subdomains, for the container base images.
>
> • registry.npmjs.org, for the dependencies of the TypeScript services and of the user interfaces.
>
> • repo.maven.apache.org, for the dependencies of the Java services.
>
> • pypi.org, for the dependencies of the Python service.
>
> • proxy.golang.org, for the dependencies of the Go service.
>
> • github.com, for downloading the project source code.

# Download and Installation

This section covers the installation of the base tools and the download of the project. On completing it, the source code will reside on the machine and the container platform will be in a position to build it.

## Installing Docker

### Procedure on Windows

> 1\. Go to the address docker.com/products/docker-desktop and download the Windows version.
>
> 2\. Run the downloaded installer and keep the option to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux instead of Hyper-V selected.
>
> 3\. Restart the machine when the installation finishes. The restart is mandatory for the subsystem to become active.
>
> 4\. Open the application from the start menu and wait until the panel indicates that the engine is running.

### Procedure on Ubuntu and Debian

```bash
# 1. Install the container engine and the orchestration plugin
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

# 2. Allow use without superuser privileges
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# 3. Log out and log back in to apply the group change
```

### Procedure on macOS

> 1\. Download the macOS version, selecting the variant corresponding to the machine's processor: Apple Silicon or Intel.
>
> 2\. Drag the application to the Applications folder and open it.
>
> 3\. Grant the permissions requested by the operating system.

### Verifying the Docker Installation

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
docker run hello-world
```

**Verification.** The first two commands must display a version number. The third must end with a message confirming that the installation works correctly. The appearance of that message certifies that the platform was installed correctly.

## Installing Git

**Table 11**

*Git installation procedure by operating system*

| **Operating system** | **Procedure**                                                                                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows              | Download the installer from git-scm.com/download/win and run it, accepting the default options            |
| Ubuntu and Debian    | Run: sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git                                                           |
| macOS                | Run: brew install git, or else install the Xcode command line tools                                       |

> git --version

**Verification.** The command must display version 2.40 or higher.

## Obtaining the Project

There are two routes for obtaining the source code. The first should be used when access to the repository is available.

### First Route: Cloning the Repository

```bash
# 1. Go to the folder where the project will be installed
cd C:\Users\<user>\Documents    # Windows
cd ~/Documents                  # Linux and macOS

# 2. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jonas7891/ProyectoFaceAttendEDU.git

# 3. Enter the folder containing the code
cd ProyectoFaceAttendEDU/FULL
```

**Warning.** All of the commands in this manual are run from the FULL folder, the root of the source code. It is the only folder from which the orchestration tool locates the configuration file and the files of the system's three tiers. Running them from another location produces configuration-not-found errors.

### Second Route: Compressed Archive

When the project is received as a compressed archive, proceed as follows:

> 1\. Extract the archive to a path whose name contains no spaces or accented characters, since such paths cause problems in some container platform commands.
>
> 2\. Open a terminal inside the resulting FULL folder.

## Verifying the Project Structure

Confirm that the root folder contains the elements represented in Figure 2.

**Figure 2**

    +-- seed-api-test-data/    optional loading of test data
```

The check is performed with the command corresponding to the operating system:

```bash
dir      # Windows
ls -la   # Linux and macOS
```

**Verification.** The files docker-compose.yml and .env.example must appear, as well as the folders back-end, database, front-end, and tools. The absence of any of them indicates that the download was incomplete, in which case the retrieval procedure must be repeated.

# Initial Configuration

All of the system configuration resides in a single file, named .env, located at the root of the FULL folder. The orchestration tool reads it automatically and distributes its values across the eighteen containers.

## Creating the Configuration File

The project includes a documented template named .env.example. The first configuration step is to copy it under the name .env:

```bash
# From the FULL folder
copy .env.example .env         # Windows, command interpreter
Copy-Item .env.example .env    # Windows, PowerShell
cp .env.example .env           # Linux and macOS
```

**Verification.** Using the command `dir .env` on Windows, or `ls -la .env` on Linux and macOS, confirm that the file exists and occupies approximately 3 kilobytes.

**Note.** For a local installation it is not necessary to modify any value, since all of the variables have functional default values. The reader may continue directly with the Bringing the System Up section and return to this section only if a port needs to be changed or if a failure occurs.

**Warning.** The configuration file is never added to the repository. It is deliberately excluded, since it contains credentials. The template values constitute development credentials and not production secrets. For a production environment, all of the passwords must be changed and managed by means of operating system variables or a secrets manager, and never by means of a file belonging to the project.

## Environment Variables

The file is organized into thematic blocks. The following tables constitute the complete reference of the available variables.

**Table 12**

*PostgreSQL configuration variables*

| **Variable**               | **Default value**          | **Element it controls**                                                                      |

| FACEATTEND_LIQUIBASE_IMAGE | liquibase/liquibase:4.29.0 | Image that runs the eight migrations                                                         |

**Table 13**

*MongoDB configuration variables*

| **Variable**   | **Default value**     | **Element it controls**                                            |

| MONGO_PORT     | 27017                 | Port on the host machine                                           |

**Table 14**

*Supporting infrastructure variables*

| **Variable**    | **Default value** | **Element it controls**                                                     |

**Table 15**

*Network exposure and web interface variables*

| **Variable**        | **Default value**     | **Element it controls**                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BIND_IP             | 127.0.0.1             | Address to which the internal ports are bound. With the default value they are accessible only from the machine itself; with the value 0.0.0.0 they become visible across the whole local network |
| FRONTEND_PORT       | 8090                  | Port of the web interface                                                                                                                                     |
| EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL | http://localhost:8080 | Address of the programming interface used by the browser                                                                                                      |

**Warning.** The EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL variable is not read at startup; instead it is baked into the web application bundle at the moment the image is built. Changing it therefore requires rebuilding the interface with the command `docker compose up -d --build frontend-web`; restarting the system is not enough. This circumstance is the most frequent cause of the interface loading but failing to connect to the programming interface.

**Table 16**

*Initial users and test data variables*

| **Variable**       | **Default value**     | **Element it controls**                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME | admin.faceattend      | Administrator user created automatically by the migrations                  |
| BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD | Admin123!ChangeMe     | Password of that user; must be changed after the first login                |
| SEED_USERNAME      | seed.admin            | User employed by the test data loading tool                                 |
| SEED_PASSWORD      | SeedAdmin123!         | Password of that user                                                       |

## Customization Cases

### First Case: The Database Port Is Occupied

When the machine has a prior PostgreSQL installation, the port on the host machine must be changed. The container's internal port remains unchanged, so the rest of the system continues to work without modification:

> POSTGRES_PORT=5433

### Second Case: Testing from a Mobile Device

The procedure comprises three modifications and one rebuild. First, find out the machine's address on the local network with `ipconfig` on Windows, or `ip addr` on Linux and macOS. Next, edit the variables:

> BIND_IP=0.0.0.0
>
> EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.1.10:8080

Finally, rebuild the web interface:

> docker compose up -d --build frontend-web

**Warning.** The gateway only accepts requests coming from three preconfigured origins. To serve the application from another address, that address must be added to the list of allowed origins in the gateway configuration. Likewise, the value 127.0.0.1 must be restored to the BIND_IP variable when the test finishes, since the value 0.0.0.0 exposes the databases to the entire local network.

### Third Case: The Gateway Port Is Occupied

> KONG_PROXY_PORT=8070
>
> EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8070

The web interface must be rebuilt afterwards, for the reason set out in the previous section.

## Email Channel

The notification service can send email messages intended for password recovery and account verification. When the mail server variable remains empty, the channel is disabled: the system continues to work normally and merely records a warning in its log files.

To test this functionality in development without having a real mail server, deploy a simulated mailbox:

> docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 axllent/mailpit

And configure the following variables:

> SMTP_HOST=host.docker.internal
>
> SMTP_PORT=1025
>
> SMTP_FROM=FaceAttend EDU \<no-reply@faceattend.local\>
>
> SMTP_STARTTLS=false

**Verification.** On going to the address http://localhost:8025 the inbox in which the messages sent by the system are received must be displayed.

# Bringing the System Up

With the project downloaded and the configuration file created, the system is deployed with a single command. The database, the tables, and the initial data are created automatically.

## Deploying the System

From the FULL folder, with the container platform running, use the following command:

> docker compose up -d --build

The command breaks down as follows:

> • The verb up creates and starts the defined containers.
>
> • The -d option keeps them running in the background and returns control of the terminal.
>
> • The --build option builds the service images before starting them; it is mandatory on the first run.

**Warning.** The first run takes a long time, since the platform must download the base images and compile the nine services in four different languages. The estimated time ranges between fifteen and forty minutes, depending on the connection speed and the capacity of the machine. Subsequent runs take between one and three minutes, since they reuse the previously built components. The process must not be interrupted; if it is cancelled, simply run the same command again.

## Startup Order

The orchestration tool does not start all of the containers simultaneously, but rather respects a dependency chain intended to prevent a service from attempting to use a resource that does not yet exist.

**Table 17**

*Phases of the system startup order*

| **Phase** | **Components that start**                                                                                                                              | **Condition for advancing**                                                                     |

**Note.** The practical consequence of this chain is that, when a migration fails, the process stops and the services that depend on it do not start. In the event of any startup difficulty, the migration logs must therefore be reviewed first.

## Database and Migrations

There is no need to create the database or to run any structured query file manually: the process is automatic and comprises two stages.

### Creation of the Schemas

The first time the relational database starts with its data volume empty, it runs an initialization file that creates the eight schemas corresponding to the system's bounded contexts: identity, authorization, academic, scheduling, attendance, biometrics, configuration, and notification.

**Note.** The organization into eight schemas, and not into eight independent databases, is due to the fact that each microservice is the exclusive owner of its schema and no service queries another's tables: references between contexts are established by means of identifiers, without physical foreign keys. This is the database-per-context pattern, implemented on a single instance for the purpose of simplifying the deployment.

### Creation of Tables and Catalog Data

The eight migration tasks apply, in order, the changes corresponding to each context: first the structure, made up of tables, indexes, and constraints, and then the indispensable catalog data (Liquibase, n.d.). These are temporary containers that run, finish, and stop; their appearance with a successful exit status in the listing is the expected result.

On subsequent startups, the migration tool detects the previously applied changes and runs only the new ones, which is why it is safe to deploy the system on a day-to-day basis.

## Initial System Data

On completion of the migrations, the system contains the minimum elements required for its use.

**Table 18**

*Predefined system roles*

| **Role**      | **Scope of privileges**                                                                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Administrator | Full access: manages users, roles, academic structure, and system configuration               |
| Instructor    | Teaching: opens and closes class sessions, records attendance, and reviews justifications     |
| Student       | Queries their own information and submits justifications                                      |

**Table 19**

*Automatically created users*

| **User**              | **Initial password**   | **Assigned role** |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| admin.faceattend      | Admin123!ChangeMe      | Administrator     |
| instructor.faceattend | Instructor123!ChangeMe | Instructor        |
| aprendiz.faceattend   | Aprendiz123!ChangeMe   | Student           |

*Note.* The password suffix expressly warns of the need to change them.

**Warning.** The above credentials are publicly known, since they appear in the project source code. They are acceptable in a development or assessment environment. In any installation accessible to third parties, the three passwords must be changed immediately after the first login and the demonstration accounts that are not going to be used must be deactivated. The procedure is described in the administrator manual.

The system's base catalogs are also loaded: the permission matrix by role, the academic actor types, the justification types, and the alert types.

## Loading Test Data

When the system is required to be populated with sample campuses, programs, cohorts, courses, and enrollments — a common situation in demonstrations and in user interface testing — the project includes a tool that creates them by means of calls to the programming interface. Running it requires Node.js version 20 or higher installed on the machine, since it does not use containers:

```bash
# With the system deployed and all of the services healthy
cd tools/seed-api-test-data
npm run seed
```

**Verification.** The process finishes with a successful exit code. Running it repeatedly is safe, since the tool detects pre-existing records and continues without duplicating them.

# Verifying the Installation

The installation must not be considered finished until this section is completed. Each test checks a different layer of the system, so they must be run in the order proposed: an early failure explains the subsequent ones.

## Checklist

The verification is considered complete when the following seven conditions are satisfied:

> 1\. The eighteen containers appear in the listing, and the service containers are running and in a healthy state.
>
> 2\. The eight migration tasks finished with a successful exit code.
>
> 3\. Each microservice responds to its health check.
>
> 4\. The gateway responds on its port.
>
> 5\. Login returns a valid session identifier.
>
> 6\. The web interface loads in the browser and allows logging in.
>
> 7\. The data layer is not reachable from the network that serves the browser.

## First Test: Container Status

> docker compose ps

**Verification.** A table of eighteen rows must be displayed. The microservices, the gateway, the web interface, and the databases must appear as running, and those that incorporate a health check must appear in a healthy state. The eight rows corresponding to the migrations must appear with a successful exit status, which certifies that they completed their task.

**Warning.** When any container appears in a permanent restart state, in an unhealthy state, or with an error exit, the installation is not complete. The logs of that container must be reviewed and the Troubleshooting section consulted before continuing.

To additionally display the published ports, the following command is used:

> docker ps --format "{{.Names}} | {{.Status}} | {{.Ports}}"

## Second Test: Service Health

Each service exposes a path that confirms its availability. These paths differ according to the implementation technology:

```bash
# Services implemented in Java
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/health      # identity
curl http://localhost:8084/actuator/health    # scheduling

# Services implemented in TypeScript
curl http://localhost:8083/health             # academic
curl http://localhost:8087/health             # configuration

# Through the gateway
curl http://localhost:8080/health/quality
```

**Verification.** Each command returns a JavaScript Object Notation response with a positive status. None of them must return a connection error.

**Note.** When the command line tool is not available on Windows, the PowerShell instruction `Invoke-RestMethod` may be used instead, or else the address may be opened directly in the browser.

## Third Test: Authentication

This is the most important test, since it traverses the complete chain — browser, gateway, identity service, and database — and confirms that the initial data was loaded correctly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"identifier\":\"admin.faceattend\",\"password\":\"Admin123!ChangeMe\"}"
```

**Verification.** A response is obtained containing a session identifier, the user identifier, and the active status of the session.

That identifier is then used to check a protected endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/persons \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <session-identifier>"
```

**Note.** The system does not use credentials in JavaScript Web Token format. On login, the identity service issues an opaque session identifier that is sent with each request by means of the authorization header. The gateway does not validate credentials: each service checks the session on its own. Consequently, an unauthorized error never comes from the gateway, but from the destination service.

## Fourth Test: Web Interface

> 1\. Open an up-to-date browser.
>
> 2\. Go to the address http://localhost:8090.
>
> 3\. Confirm that the system login screen loads.
>
> 4\. Log in with the administrator user credentials.
>
> 5\. Confirm access to the main panel corresponding to the administrator role.

**Verification.** The interface loads, accepts the credentials, and displays the panel. If the page loads but the login does not respond, open the browser developer tools and review the console: connection errors almost always indicate that the programming interface address does not match, a situation addressed in the Troubleshooting section.

The services implemented in Java additionally publish their interactive documentation at the addresses http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html and equivalents for ports 8082, 8084, and 8085.

## Fifth Test: Network Isolation

This test confirms that the separation into three networks is working: neither the web interface nor the gateway must be able to reach the database.

```bash
# The following two commands must FAIL
docker exec faceattend-frontend-web nslookup postgres
docker exec faceattend-kong getent hosts postgres

# The following command must WORK
docker exec faceattend-kong getent hosts ms-identity
```

**Verification.** The first two commands return a name resolution error and the third returns a network address. If the web interface manages to resolve the database name, the networks are not correctly separated and the data layer would be reachable from the layer exposed to the browser.

Once the five tests are passed, the installation is considered complete and verified. The system is in a position to be used in accordance with the user manual, or to be configured with real users in accordance with the administrator manual.

# Installing the Mobile Application

The mobile application is not deployed by means of containers; instead it is run in development mode and opened on a physical phone or in an emulator. Its installation is optional with respect to the main system.

## Additional Requirements

**Table 20**

*Additional requirements of the mobile application*

| **Requirement**        | **Detail**                                                                                              |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node.js                | Version 20 or higher, installed on the machine                                                          |
| Expo client application| Installed on the phone, from the corresponding app store                                                |
| Network                | The phone and the machine must be on the same wireless network                                          |
| Main system            | Must be deployed and accessible from the local network, with the exposure variable set to 0.0.0.0       |

## Installation Procedure

```bash
# 1. Find out the machine's address on the local network
ipconfig    # Windows
ip addr     # Linux
ifconfig    # macOS

# 2. Enter the mobile application folder
cd front-end/Mobile

# 3. Install the dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npx expo start
```

**Warning.** From the phone, the loopback designation `localhost` refers to the phone itself and not to the computer. It is mandatory to use the machine's address on the local network in the mobile application configuration, and to keep the exposure variable set to 0.0.0.0 in the main system configuration file.

On starting up, the development tool displays a quick response code in the terminal. Open the client application on the phone and scan that code, after which the application is downloaded to the device and runs.

**Verification.** The application displays the login screen and allows logging in with the student user credentials. If the screen loads but login fails, the problem lies in the programming interface address or in the machine's firewall, which may be blocking the gateway port.

# Day-to-Day Operation

## Frequently Used Commands

**Table 21**

*Frequent operation commands*

| **Command**                                 | **Effect**                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| docker compose up -d                        | Starts the system reusing the previously built images                        |
| docker compose up -d --build                | Rebuilds the images before starting; used after modifying the code           |
| docker compose ps                           | Displays the status and health of each container                             |
| docker compose logs -f ms-identity          | Displays a service's logs in real time                                      |
| docker compose logs --tail=100 kong-gateway | Displays the last one hundred log lines of a service                        |
| docker compose restart ms-academic          | Restarts an individual service                                              |
| docker compose config                       | Validates the configuration without deploying the system                    |
| docker compose down                         | Stops and removes the containers, preserving the data                       |
| docker stats                                | Displays the processor and memory consumption of each container             |

## Stopping and Restarting the System

```bash
# Stop the system preserving all of the data
docker compose down

# Start it again
docker compose up -d
```

**Note.** Stopping the system removes the containers but not the data volumes: the database, the biometric vectors, and the events remain intact. On deploying it again, the system continues in the state in which it was left.

## Updating to a New Version

```bash
# 1. Bring in the changes from the repository
git pull origin develop

# 2. Check whether the configuration template added new variables
#    and, if so, add them to the local configuration file

# 3. Rebuild and start; the pending migrations are applied by themselves
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Uninstallation

**Warning.** The first command in the following block irreversibly deletes all of the system's data: users, attendance records, justifications, and biometric vectors. The operation cannot be undone, so it must be run only when starting from scratch is intended.

```bash
# Removes containers and data volumes
docker compose down -v

# Additionally removes the built images
docker compose down -v --rmi all

# Finally, delete the project folder if it is no longer needed
```

# Troubleshooting

This section gathers the difficulties that occur most frequently, ordered according to the stage of the procedure at which they usually appear. Each entry sets out the symptom, the probable cause, and the instructions leading to its resolution.

## Initial Diagnosis

In the event of any failure, run the following three commands, which in most cases identify the cause:

```bash
docker compose ps                      # which container is failing
docker compose logs --tail=50 <name>   # what that container reports
docker compose config                  # whether the configuration is valid
```

## Problems During Installation

*Frequent problems during installation*

| **Symptom**                                      | **Probable cause**                                                                  | **Solution**                                                                                                                         |

| The build fails while downloading dependencies   | No connection, or a corporate proxy server is blocking the repositories             | Verify the connection and access to the domains listed in the Prerequisites section, and retry the build without cache               |
| No space left on device                          | Disk saturated with unused images and containers                                    | Prune the unused resources and confirm that at least 20 GB remain free                                                               |

## Problems When Deploying the System

### The Port Address Is Already Allocated

The cause is that another program on the machine is using that port. The most frequent case corresponds to a prior PostgreSQL installation occupying port 5432.

```bash
# 1. Identify the process occupying the port
netstat -ano | findstr ":5432"   # Windows
lsof -i :5432                    # Linux and macOS

# 2a. Stop that process
taskkill /PID <identifier> /F    # Windows
kill -9 <identifier>             # Linux and macOS

# 2b. Or else change the port in the configuration file
docker compose up -d
```

### A Service Declares an Undefined Dependency

The error occurs when the deployment is run from the services folder instead of the project root. That file, on its own, does not define the database, which resides in another folder. The solution is always to run the deployment from the root. This is a deliberate design error, intended to make evident which is the correct entry point.

### A Container Remains in an Endless Restart Loop

> docker compose logs --tail=100 \<service-name\>

The usual causes include that the database was not yet available, a situation that resolves itself after a few retries; that an environment variable is missing; or that the service cannot resolve the name of another container. If after five minutes the container is still restarting, the complete system must be restarted.

### The Web Interface Shows an Unhealthy Status

The known cause is that the health check must use the numeric loopback address and not its name, since inside the container that name also resolves to the sixth-version internet protocol address, on which the web server is not listening, so the connection is refused. The project file already incorporates the fix; if the symptom appears, the web interface must be rebuilt.

## Problems with the Migrations

### A Migration Ends with an Error

The migration chain stops and no subsequent service starts. Identify which one failed and for what reason:

```bash
# 1. Identify the failed migration
docker compose ps | findstr liquibase   # Windows
docker compose ps | grep liquibase      # Linux and macOS

# 2. Check the reason for the failure
docker compose logs identity-liquibase

# 3. After correcting, re-run only that migration
docker compose up identity-liquibase

# 4. The chain continues on the next startup
docker compose up -d
```

**Warning.** As a last resort, when the database is left in an inconsistent state and this is a test environment, it may be reset from scratch by deleting the volumes. That operation erases all of the data and must never be run on an installation containing real information.

### The System Reports That a Table or a Schema Does Not Exist

The cause is that the migrations were not run or were left incomplete. Verify that the eight tasks finished with a successful exit code and review the logs of the first one that did not.

| The machine becomes considerably slow after deployment | The eighteen containers, four of them with a Java virtual machine, consume a noticeable amount of memory. Close the other applications and allocate at least 6 GB of memory to the container platform. Consumption per container can be examined with the statistics command |
| The build takes more than an hour                | This is normal behavior on the first run with a slow connection, since approximately 5 GB are downloaded. Subsequent runs are considerably faster. The process must not be interrupted                                                                       |
| The containers stop by themselves               | The platform ran out of the allocated memory. Increase it or deploy only the required services                                                                                                                                                              |

## Clean Restart Procedure

When the previous alternatives are exhausted and the system still does not work, the following procedure restores the state of a fresh installation:

```bash
# 1. Stop and remove everything, including the data
docker compose down -v

# 2. Prune the unused resources
docker system prune -a

# 3. Verify that the configuration file exists and is correct

# 4. Rebuild from scratch
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Warning.** The procedure deletes all of the system's data, so it must be used exclusively in development or assessment environments.

## Incident Escalation

When a difficulty is not resolved by the previous procedures, it must be reported using the format in Appendix D. The report must attach the output of the three initial diagnostic commands; without that evidence, remote diagnosis is practically unfeasible.

# Installation Without Containers

**Warning.** This section is optional and is not recommended for an ordinary installation. It is relevant only when the code of a service is to be modified and debugged from the development environment. To install and use the system, the container-based procedure is faster and considerably less error-prone.

## Tools Required by Programming Language

Each service requires its own runtime environment installed on the machine.

**Table 25**

*Tools required by programming language*

| **Language** | **Version** | **Affected services**                                  | **Source**       | **Verification** |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Java         | 21 LTS      | Identity, authorization, scheduling, and attendance    | adoptium.net     | java --version   |
| Maven        | 3.9         | The same four services                                 | maven.apache.org | mvn --version    |
| Node.js      | 20          | Academic, configuration, quality, and both interfaces  | nodejs.org       | node --version   |
| Python       | 3.12        | Biometrics                                             | python.org       | python --version |
| Go           | 1.22        | Notifications                                          | go.dev           | go version       |

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Mode

The usual practice is not to dispense with containers entirely, but to deploy the whole infrastructure with them — databases, messaging, gateway, and the services that are not being modified — and to run outside them only the service being worked on:

```bash
# 1. Deploy only the data layer and the migrations
docker compose up -d database

# 2. Run a service from its folder, according to the language
cd back-end/01-ms-identity && mvn spring-boot:run
cd back-end/03-ms-academic && npm install && npm run dev
cd back-end/06-ms-biometric && uvicorn main:app --reload
cd back-end/08-ms-notification && go run ./cmd/server
```

**Note.** The services read the same configuration file used by the containers. On starting up outside them, each service loads the configuration from the project root by means of the mechanism native to its language, so there is no need to duplicate the configuration.

## Web Interface in Development Mode

```bash
cd front-end/Web
npm install
npx expo start --web
```

The interface starts with automatic reloading when changes are saved.

# Security Recommendations

The following guidance applies from the moment the installation stops being an isolated test environment and becomes accessible to third parties.

## Credentials

> • Change the three bootstrap passwords immediately after the first login and deactivate the demonstration accounts that are not going to be used.
>
> • Replace the default credentials of the relational and document databases with values specific to the installation.
>
> • Do not share the configuration file over messaging channels and do not attach it to incident reports without first removing the passwords.
>
> • Keep the configuration file outside the repository; its exclusion is already declared in the project and must not be reverted.

## Network Exposure

> • Keep the exposure variable set to the loopback address, so that the databases and the microservices are unreachable from the local network.
>
> • Restore that value at the end of any test that required opening the ports to the network.
>
> • Publish only the two ports intended for the outside: that of the web interface and that of the gateway.
>
> • Verify the isolation between networks by means of the fifth test of the Verifying the Installation section after every change to the infrastructure.

## Preservation of Information

> • Run the stop command without the volume removal option in day-to-day operation, since that option destroys all of the data irreversibly.
>
> • Generate a backup before any update that incorporates new migrations, in accordance with the procedure described in the administrator manual.
>
> • Reserve the clean restart procedure for development or assessment environments.

## Handover to the System Administrator

On completing the installation, the installer hands over to the administrator the initial credentials, the warning about their mandatory modification, and the evidence that the verification protocol was carried out in full. From that moment on, responsibility for the system rests with the administrator and is governed by their own manual.

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Container                  | Package comprising a program and everything necessary for it to work: base system, libraries, and configuration. It runs isolated from the rest of the machine, so it behaves identically on any machine |
| Image                      | Read-only template from which containers are created. Building an image is equivalent to compiling the service and packaging it; starting a container is equivalent to running a copy of that image      |
| Docker                     | Platform that builds and runs containers                                                                                                                                                                |

| Gateway                    | Component that receives all of the external requests and directs them to the corresponding microservice. It also applies the cross-origin policy and the rate limit                                      |
| Kong                       | Open-source gateway used in the project. It is configured declaratively, without a database of its own                                                                                                  |

| Schema                     | Logical subdivision within a relational database. The system uses a single database divided into eight schemas, one per context                                                                          |
| Migration                  | Versioned change to the database structure. Migrations are applied in order and are recorded, so that they are never run twice                                                                           |
| Liquibase                  | Tool that runs the migrations. In the project it comprises eight tasks, one per schema, which are run automatically during the deployment                                                                |
| Seed data                  | Minimum records the system requires in order to start: roles, permissions, justification types, and the initial administrator user                                                                       |
